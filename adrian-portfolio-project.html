       <div class="joy"
        <p>On my quest to learn new things and to increse my skill set I applied to join Moringa which so far has really helped me
        .Also I beleive that I this generation eveything and evey proffession must include <span> Technology </span> so in order to be competent and relevant in this fieldset
         one must strive to have basic knowlegde concerning computers.</p>
        <p>Another reason is that I realized that having this coding skills can help me really much especially when I need a side hustle and require money</p>
